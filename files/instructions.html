        <h2>So, like, how does this thing work?</h2>
        Each game has some <i>locations,</i> which have <i>objects</i> inside of them.
        The locations are connected by <i>paths.</i>
        Each object can have <i>actions</i> and <i>pick up actions.</i>
        Paths, actions, and pick up actions can have <i>constraints</i> and <i>effects.</i>
        <h2>Cool. But what is a location?</h2>
        A location is a place the player can be in.
        To add a location, click the "add a location" button.
        Click on the name of a location to see what's inside.
        <h2>What's an object?</h2>
        An object is something the player can interact with.
        To add an object, click the "add an object" button.
        <h2>What are paths?</h2>
        A path is a way to get from one location to another.
        To add a path, click the "add a path" button under the location you start from.
        You can then select a location for the path to lead to.
        When playing the game, to use a path, type: "go to <i>location</i>"
        where <i>location</i> is the name of the location you want to go to.
        <h2>Do paths work in both directions?</h2>
        No. If you want one to, you will need two paths.
        <h2>What's an action?</h2>
        Actions are ways to do stuff. Actions either use one object or two.
        If they use one, click "add an action" under the object. Leave the selector box empty.
        In the game, type "use <i>object</i>" to do the action.
        You must be in the same location as the object or have it in your inventory for it to work.
        Actions don't do anything on their own, you need to add effects first. More on that later.
        If the action uses two objects,
        you will have to type "use <i>object 1</i> on <i>object 2</i>" in the game.
        Create the action under object 1, then set the select box to object 2.
        You need object 1 in your inventory and object 2 in your inventory or the location you are in.
        <h2>How do I use a pick up action?</h2>
        Create a pick up action under the object you want to pick up.
        In the game, type "pick up <i>object</i>", "get <i>object</i>", or "grab <i>object</i>".
        It will add the object to your inventory.
        If you don't want it to, deselect the "success" checkbox.
        <h2>What are constraints and effects?</h2>
        Constraints are ways to only allow you to do something under certain conditions.
        Effects are ways to make things happen when you do stuff.
        Constraints and effects can be added to paths, actions, and pick up actions.
        Click on them first to open them up.
        <br>
        There are three types of each:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Regualar effects, which set the state of an object or location.
                Constraints check the state.
                Choose an object or location with the select box, then type in the name of the state or select from a list.
                "default" means the state it starts in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Location effects change the location of objects.
                Location constraints check their location.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inventory effects add objects to your inventory.
                Inventory constraints check if objects are in your inventory.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Can I add multiple constraints or effects to the same object?</h2>
        Yes!
        <h2>What are all the textboxes?</h2>
        The textbox at the top of the page is what you see when you start the game.
        The boxes under locations are what you see when you are in them.
        These have different parts, which you can add by pressing the "+" buttons.
        You can add constraints to different parts to effect what you see based on the state of the game.
        The boxes on actions, paths, and pick up actions is what you see when you do them.
        Pick up actions add "You have an <i>object</i>." if you get it.
        If there is no text, it says "Nothing happens."
        It also says that when you try to do something that doesn't exist.
        <h2>How do I make my game fun?</h2>
        There's no simple formula for how to make it fun, but here are a few tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Make multiple ways to solve it.</li>
            <li>Be descriptive.</li>
            <li>Don't make it too hard. It's no fun being stuck for an hour without figuring anything out.</li>
            <li>Call locations and objects by name.
                You don't want the player to do the right thing with the wrong word and have it not work.</li>
            <li>Test it. You might notice something wrong you didn't realise when you made it.</li>
            <li>Get someone else to test it too. They don't know exactly how to solve it,
                so when they get stuck you will know what parts are too hard.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Can my game have hints?</h2>
        There is no built in support for hints, but you can give players ideas in the location descriptions.
        You can also do a sneaky trick by making a "hint" object and adding a pick up action with the "success" box deselected.
        Don't add any effects, but make the text tell you what to do.
        Tell the players to type "get hint" when they are stuck so they will know there are hints.
        <h2>I wanna share my game with my friends.</h2>
        Click the "get and copy join link" button. Paste the link in an email or text to your friend.
        If they have an account, they can use the link to add your game to their list of games.
        They will be able to play your game, but not edit.
        Once they click the link, thier username will be at the end of the page. (You will need to reload first.)
        You can change their permissions using the select box. "Player" means they can play your game.
        "Editor" means they can play and edit. "Operator" means they can play, edit, and effect other player permissions,
        including sending join links and stopping you from playing your game.
        Clicking the "revoke" button stops them from doing anything with your game.
        <h2>Can I publish my game?</h2>
        No.
        <h2>I found a bug in this program, what should I do?</h2>
        You can sumbit a bug report <a href="https://github.com/DanielVenable/text-adventure-game/issues">here</a>.
